I'm a senior high school student at Chongqing Nankai Secondary School. I'm interested in high-energy astrophysics and cosmology, particularly black hole physics and dark matter physics. I'm especially interested in studying asteriod-mass primordial black holes as a dark matter candidate, and exploring possible ways to probe them.
