I'm a senior high school student at Chongqing Nankai Secondary School. I'm interested in high-energy astrophysics and cosmology, particularly black hole physics and dark matter physics. I'm especially interested in studying asteriod-mass primordial black holes as a dark matter candidate, and exploring possible ways to probe them.

My paper on the charge accumulation effect that can occur when asteroid-mass primordial black holes transit main-sequence stars is available at this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1glccMBW4A75I8V8ozWcUkhE7KpnAniMn/view?usp=sharing
